## What is a data-driven CV?

-   What we're talking about here is *automating CV and resume creation*
-   We can use packages like [vitae](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/) or [datadrivencv](https://nickstrayer.me/datadrivencv/)
-   This is different than a *data-driven resume approach* such as described [here](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-can-you-make-your-resume-more-data-driven-analytical-gzgvc#:~:text=A%20data%2Ddriven%20resume%20is,by%20following%20these%20six%20tips.)
    -   This approach is about concisely summarizing your experience backed by quantitative metrics and evidence

## Using Data to Dynamically Build your CV

-   Set up an automated pipeline where:
    -   Your CV or resume is continuously and seamlessly updated
    -   Input new data - render (compile / knit) - resume is updated!
    -   Document production through code
    -   Updates happen in tables or spreadsheets in the cloud (i.e. Google Sheets or OneDrive)
    -   Updates to underlying *data* can feed multiple resumes / CVs if needed
    -   Whenever underlying data changes, .Rmd is re-rendered

## Under the Hood

-   CV is constructed as an .Rmd
-   The high-level information is in your yaml with key-value pairs
-   Everything in the body of your CV / resume is in your code blocks - the tags in your code fencing in chunks are used by `vitae` and are matched with a corresponding header in a table with the information for that topic
-   The entries for each section are a code block in your .Rmd `detailed_entries` parameters - this is all just a wrapper for `LaTex` template (this is the engine for constructing resume)
-   The secret sauce: YAML front matter - R Markdown  - Pandoc - LaTex template
