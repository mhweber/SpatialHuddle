## First, A Caveat

-   Most material in these slides is borrowed shamelessly from the [Positron presentations](https://youtu.be/8uRcB34Hhsw) for the [2024 Posit conference](https://posit.co/blog/five-highlights-from-posit-conf-2024/)

## What is Positron?

-   [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron#readme) is a next-generation data science IDE (as opposed to software engineer IDE)
    -   Code-first mentality
    -   A polyglot IDE where you can do all your data science (currently support for just R and Python)
    -   Most IDEs out there built primarily for just one language (i.e. RStudio, Spyder, MATLAB)
    -   Uses languages as 'language packs' on the backend - highly extensible

## Why Positron?

-   You can use more than one language easily and seamlessly
-   Extensible and familiar
-   Design inspired by RStudio
-   Fundamentals based on OpenOSS - the open-source foundation of VSCode{r} install.packages('ggplot2')

## How does it work? Extensibility

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Extensibility: languages are not 'baked in' - they come as 'language 'packs'
-   Programming languages communicate through an API with the IDE
-   Switch between languages and language versions easily in same session using the interpreter selector
