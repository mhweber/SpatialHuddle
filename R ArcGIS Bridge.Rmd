## What is the R-ArcGIS Bridge?

The [R ArcGIS Bridge](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/r-arcgis-bridge/overview) at it's fundamental level is implemented with the `arcgisbinding` package which:

-   Uses R from ArcGIS Pro

-   Loads data and tools from ArcPro in your R project

-   [Getting Started](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/r-arcgis-bridge/get-started)


## Setting up the R ArcGIS Bridge

## The R - ESRI Ecosystem

We'll talk about more, but `arcgisbinding` is now couched [within a collection of packages for integrating R and the ArcGIS ecosystem](https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/)

![](r-bridge.png){width=75%}

## Check installation from R

First we'll explore the `arcgisbinding` package. We'll check the installation we did from ArcPro in R:

```{r}
library(arcgisbinding)
arc.check_product()
```

## Using the R-ArcGIS Bridge
I'll demonstrate the basic functions of the `arcgisbinding` package following along with the [arcgisbinding vignette](https://r.esri.com/assets/arcgisbinding-vignette.html) for starters.

The main function of the R-ArcGIS Bridge is to move data from ArcPro to R and vice versa. The primary functions in R include:

-   `arc.open()`
-   `arc.select()`
-   `arc.shapeinfo()`

Among others

## Test it with sample data

```{r}
ozone.path <- system.file("extdata", "ca_ozone_pts.shp",                package="arcgisbinding")
ozone.arc.dataset <- arc.open(ozone.path)
```

## The `arc.dataset` object
What we get back from `arc.open` in R is an `arc.dataset` object which will bring us all back to the good old `sp` days - an s4 object (shudder..)
```{r}
ozone.arc.dataset@shapeinfo
```

You can get details of your geometry with `arc.shape` or `arc.shapeinfo` 

```{r}
ozone.shapeinfo <- arc.shapeinfo(ozone.arc.dataset)
ozone.shapeinfo$WKT
```

## Selects and filters using SQL syntax
We can fiter rows and select columns to read in from a spatial data layer using the `arc.select` function
```{r}
ozone.dataframe <- arc.select(object = ozone.arc.dataset, fields = c("FID", "Shape", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE", "ELEVATION", "OZONE"), where_clause = "ELEVATION >= 1000")
head(ozone.dataframe)
```

## Conversion
Easy to convert to `sf` object
```{r}
library(sf)
sf_data <- arc.data2sf(ozone.dataframe)
sf_data
```

![](ozone.png){width=75%}

## Writing data

```{r}
arc.write('C:/Users/mweber/GitProjects/SpatialHuddle/test.gdb/ozone', sf_data, overwrite = TRUE)
```

## Creating tool in ArcPro working with rasters
We can wrap arcgisbinding and R functionality into a geoprocessing script and call as a tool in ArcPro as described [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/geoprocessing/creating-gp-tools/)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tool_exec <- function(in_params, out_params) { # <1>
  # ... do things here.. 
  out_params #<2>
}
```

![](ScriptTool.png){width=75%}

## Working with rasters
We can aslo work with raster data in our ArcPro projects in R - reading in as a 
```{r}
data.path <- arc.open('C:/Users/mweber/GitProjects/PlanetaryComputer/LC09_L2SP_218072_20230914_20230916_02_T1_SR_B2.TIF')
sat.dat <- arc.raster(data.path)
sat.dat
```
## Working with rasters
```{r}
class(sat.dat)
```

## Working with rasters
```{r}
rsat <- as.raster(sat.dat)
class(rsat)
```

## Beyond `arcgisbinding` library
Remember the R-ArcGIS Bridge is **a collection of R packages** designed to integrate the R language with the ArcGIS Ecosystem. The R-ArcGIS Bridge can be used to:

- Create R-based geoprocessing tools
- Access and publish data on ArcGIS Online, Enterprise, or Platform
- Geocode addresses at scale
- Access detailed point of interest (POI) data

## Beyond `arcgisbinding` library

-`arcgisutils`: manages authorization for all location service R packages and other utilities
-`arcgislayers`: provides read and write access to layers on ArcGIS Online, Enterprise, and Platform
-`arcgisgeocode`: geocode addresses and reverse geocode point data
-`arcgisplaces`: access point-of-interest data from the ArcGIS Places Service

## Beyond `arcgisbinding` library
As described [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/installation/) to install the `arcgis` metapackage (which includes the other four R-ArcGIS bridge packages besides `arcgisbinding`) the steps are the same as installing any other R packages:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("arcgis", repos = c("https://r-arcgis.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
library(arcgis)
```

Or individually:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
pkgs <- c("arcgisutils", "arcgislayers", "arcgisgeocode", "arcgisplaces")

install.packages(pkgs, repos = c("https://r-arcgis.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

## `arcgislayers`

- Example here is from the [GitHub repo for arcgislayers](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgislayers) and follows [material I presented to R user group on web services in R](https://github.com/mhweber/SpatialHuddle/blob/master/WebServices.qmd)
- This example reads in the ESRI Rest service for the same waterbody features as the previous example
```{r}
library(arcgis, quietly = TRUE)
url <- "https://services.arcgis.com/P3ePLMYs2RVChkJx/arcgis/rest/services/USA_Water_Bodies/FeatureServer/0"
wb <- arcgislayers::arc_open(url)
```

## `arcgislayers`

- By using `list_fields` we can find out more about the service and what attributes we can query (rather than reading in the whole layer)
```{r}
list_fields(wb)
```

## `arcgislayers`
We can spatially subset this REST service to Oregon using `arc_select` in `arcgislayers` 

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| error: false
#| smaller: true

OR_wb <- arcgislayers::arc_select(wb, fields = c("FEATURE", "NAME", "STATE"), 
  where = "STATE = 'OR'")
head(OR_wb)
```
## `arcgislayers`

-   We can also use `sf` features to use as a spatial query template for pulling in ESRI REST service layers
-   Here we pass a similar `arc_select` query as last time but apply a spatial filter on waterbodies to filter to just those in Oregon
-   We get the state boundary using the `AOI` package

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| error: false
#| output-location: slide
OR <- AOI::aoi_get(state='OR')
OR_wb <- arcgislayers::arc_select(
  wb,
  filter_geom = sf::st_bbox(OR)
)
mapview::mapview(OR_wb, col.regions='light blue',map.types = "OpenStreetMap")
```

## `arcgislayers`

-   Try ECHO ESRI service <https://echogeo.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/ECHO/Facilities/MapServer>
-   Note that we need to drill down to a particular numbered feature layer in code below to grab particular features

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| error: false
url <- "https://echogeo.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/ECHO/Facilities/MapServer/3"

rcra <- arcgislayers::arc_open(url)
rcra
```

## `arcgislayers`

-   Again we use `list_fields` to figure out field query options

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| error: false
arcgislayers::list_fields(rcra)
```

## `arcgislayers`

-   Use a fields based query
-   Use `mapview` to display the result of our query

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| error: false
#| output-location: slide
rcra_pdx <- arcgislayers::arc_select(
  rcra, 
  fields = c("GLOBALID", "RCR_NAME", "RCR_CITY","RCR_STATE","RCR_ZIP","RCRA_CURR_COMPL_STATUS","DFR_URL"), 
  where = "RCR_ZIP = '97209'"
)
mapview::mapview(rcra_pdx)
```

## `arcgislayers`

-   Here we use the `AOI` package for convenience georeferencing to get the spatial boundary of Benton County in Oregon to use as a spatial filter

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| error: false
#| output-location: slide
Benton <- AOI::aoi_get(state = "OR", county= "Benton")
rcra_benton <- arcgislayers::arc_select(
  rcra,
  fields = c("GLOBALID", "RCR_NAME", "RCR_CITY","RCR_STATE","RCR_ZIP","RCRA_CURR_COMPL_STATUS","DFR_URL"),
  filter_geom = sf::st_bbox(Benton))
mapview::mapview(rcra_benton)
```

## `arcgislayers`

-   Here we again use `arc_open` to read in one of the many layers available as EJSCREEN REST layers

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| error: false
url <- "https://ejscreen.epa.gov/ArcGIS/rest/services/ejscreen/socioeconomic_indicators_2023_public/MapServer/4"

unemployment <- arcgislayers::arc_open(url)
unemployment
```

## `arcgislayers`

Again we can use `list_fields` to figure out field query options

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| error: false
list_fields(unemployment)
```

## `arcgislayers`

-   Use `AOI` to get a county spatial boundary for a filter (this time Multnomah county around Portland, Oregon)
-   Pass that spatial filter to `arc_select` for an EJSCREEN socioeconomic indicators layer

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| error: false
#| output-location: slide
Multnomah <- AOI::aoi_get(state = "OR", county= "Multnomah")
unemployment_multnomah <- arcgislayers::arc_select(
  unemployment,
  filter_geom = sf::st_bbox(Multnomah))
mapview::mapview(unemployment_multnomah, zcol = "T_UNEMPPCT")
```

## `arcgisgeocode`
[arcgisgeocode](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisgeocode) provides access to ArcGIS geocoding services from R. We can reverse geocode as well as look up addresses - note there is also ability to batch geocode but it requires autentication and uses ESRI credits

```{r}
library(arcgisgeocode)

# Find addresses from locations
rev_loc <- reverse_geocode(c(-123.291, 44.565))
rev_loc$address
```
