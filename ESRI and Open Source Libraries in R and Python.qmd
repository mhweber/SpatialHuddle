## Context of CodeBase for StreamCat

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## First show example of HyRiver querying StreamCat data

```{python}
#|echo: true
#| output-location: slide
from pygeohydro import NWIS, WBD
from pynhd import NLDI, streamcat

nldi = NLDI()
upstream_network = nldi.navigate_byid(
    "comid", 23763517, "upstreamTributaries", "flowlines", distance=9999
)
m = upstream_network.plot()
m
```
## test
```{python}
m = upstream_network.explore()
m
```


## Then show querying StreamCat using StreamCatTools


## Show how we set up environment in Python

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
#|echo: true
1 + 1
```
