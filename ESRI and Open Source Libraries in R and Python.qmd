## Watershed information in an API 
- Generating watershed information can be complicated for large watersheds when the desired metrics are needed at many sites across a large geographic extent
- For this reason we developed the [StreamCat](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat-dataset) and [LakeCat](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/lakecat-dataset) datasets

## StreamCat and LakeCat

::: columns

::: {.column width="40%"}
- StreamCat:
  - Watershed summaries of several hundred metrics for local catchments and watersheds
  - Uses NHDPlusV2 flowlines (~2.6 million stream segments)

::: {.column width="40%"}
- LakeCat 
  - Watershed summaries of several hundred metrics lakes 
  - Uses NHDPlusV2 waterbodies (for ~400,000 lakes)

## Accessing StreamCat and LakeCat

- Both datasets are now accessible via an API through:
  - A simple [leafmap interface]() and [menu interface]()
  - [StreamCatTools package](https://usepa.github.io/StreamCatTools/)
  - [pynhd]() which is part of the [HyRiver suite of Python packages]() that provide a unified API for retrieving hydro-climatic geospatial/temporal data from various web services 

## Accessing StreamCat and LakeCat

- We'll explore accessing the data via these tools in the next few slides
- Then we'll walk through the underlying code base and tools demonstrating workflows using open source and ESRI tools in Python and R

## Context of CodeBase for StreamCat

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## First show example of HyRiver querying StreamCat data

```{python}
#|echo: true
#| output-location: slide
from pygeohydro import NWIS, WBD
from pynhd import NLDI, streamcat

nldi = NLDI()
upstream_network = nldi.navigate_byid(
    "comid", 23763517, "upstreamTributaries", "flowlines", distance=9999
)
m = upstream_network.plot()
m
```
## test
```{python}
m = upstream_network.explore()
m
```


## Then show querying StreamCat using StreamCatTools


## Show how we set up environment in Python

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
#|echo: true
1 + 1
```
