## What is WhiteboxTools?

-   Advanced open source geospatial Analysis Software developed by [Prof. John Lindsey](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/index.html)
-   ~ 500 different geospatial tools
-   Inherently supports parallel processing
-   Doesn't rely on `gdal`!
-   Can be run as a stand alone simple application, run from scripting languages, or used as an add-on in geospatial software (e.g. ArcPro and QGIS)

## What is WhiteboxTools (cont.)?

-   Think of it as highly efficient, optimized set of additional tools for geospatial processing
-   Good for a number of typical GIS and remote sensing tasks
-   Focus on many specialized spatial hydrologic and LIDAR processing tasks
-   Not a cartographic or visualization tool; strictly an analytical processing toolset
-   We'll look at using in the stand-alone mode, with ArcPro, QGIS, Python, and see a worked example of using R `whitebox`

## Whitebox Runner

-   Run the `whitebox_runner.exe` file in directory where you downloaded WBT ![](WBR1.png)

## Whiteboxtools with ArcPro

-   You can install an ArcPro toolbox frontend to the stand-alone executable back-end via the [GitHub repository maintained by Quisheng Wu](https://github.com/opengeos/WhiteboxTools-ArcGIS)
-   Just download the zip file from the clone or download button on the repository
-   Unzip locally and add the downloaded toolbox to your ArcPro toolbox

## Whiteboxtools with QGIS

-   You can install Plugins in QGIS both for WhiteboxTools as well as Whitebox Workflows ![](QGIS_WBT.png)

## Whiteboxtools in Python

-   To use Whiteboxtools in Python you have two choices of Python libraries:
    - whitebox_tools.py maintained by Quisheng Wu *or*
    - Whitebox Workflows (WBW)
    - whitebox_tools.py uses Whitebox Open Core
    - WBW is supposed to provide a more natural Python interaction and improved performance over using whitebox_tools.py and Whitebox Open Core

## Whiteboxtools in R

- To use Whiteboxtools in R you can install the [R Whitebox package developed by Quisheng Wu](https://whiteboxr.gishub.org/) from CRAN or GitHub 
  - install.packages("whitebox") 
  or
  - remotes::install_github("opengeos/whiteboxR", build = FALSE)
  
- You then either initialize your environment to where you downloaded the WhiteboxTools binary, or you can use the package supplied method to download the binary:
  - whitebox::install_whitebox()
