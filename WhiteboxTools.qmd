## What is WhiteboxTools?

-   Advanced open source geospatial Analysis Software developed by [Prof. John Lindsey](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/index.html)
-   Over 500 different geospatial tools
-   Inherently supports parallel processing
-   Doesn't rely on `gdal`!
-   Can be run as a stand alone simple application, run from scripting languages, or used as an add-on in geospatial software (e.g. ArcPro and QGIS)

## What is WhiteboxTools (cont.)?

-   This of it as highly efficient, optimized set of additional tools for geospatial processing
-   Good for a number of typical GIS and remote sensing tasks
-   Focus on many specialized spatial hydrologic and LIDAR processing tasks
-   Not a cartographic or visualization tool; strictly an analytical processing toolset
-   We'll look at using in the stand-alone mode, with ArcPro, QGIS, Python, and see a worked example of using R `whitebox`

## Stand-alone mode

## Whiteboxtools with ArcPro

-   You can install an ArcPro toolbox frontend to the stand-alone executable back-end via the [GitHub repository maintained by Quisheng Wu](https://github.com/opengeos/WhiteboxTools-ArcGIS)
-   Just download the zip file from the clone or download button on the repository
-   Unzip locally and add the downloaded toolbox to your ArcPro toolbox
